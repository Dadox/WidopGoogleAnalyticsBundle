The ```WidopGoogleAnalyticsBundle``` provides a way to use certificate-based authentication in server-to-server
interactions for google analytics.

In other words, no user interaction will be required thanks to the ".p12" certificate and you will be able to automate
your google analytics authentication and authorization processes.
